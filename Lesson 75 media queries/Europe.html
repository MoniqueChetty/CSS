            <h3>Europe</h3>

            <div>
                <p>In two years, visiting Europe is going to get a bit more complicated for American travelers.
                    <br>Starting in 2021, United States citizens will be required to undergo a pre-screening and registration process called the European Travel Information and Authorization System (ETIAS) before entering European Schengen-zone countries.
                </p>
                <p> The Schengen area is comprised of 26 countries, including Austria, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Portugal and Spain.
                    <br>Currently, Americans are allowed to travel visa-free to these countries for less than 90 days with no prior screening.
                    <br>In a few years, there will be more to it.
                    <br>Here's how the process works â€“ Each traveler must apply online, which includes filling out personal biometric questions
                    <br>(name, date of birth, etc.), passport information as well as questions about the applicant's health,
                    <br>criminal record and any previous European immigration history.
                </p>
                <p>Barcelona, Rome, and Amsterdam are among the three most visited cities in Europe.
                    <br>These three cities have been welcoming tourists for decades.
                    <br>Known for friendly and welcoming locals, who believed in providing true hospitality and
                    <br>plenty of local experiences to equally grateful visitors.

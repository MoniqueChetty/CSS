    <h3>About me</h3>
    <div>
        <p>I’m originally from sleepy Suffolk in the UK. I’m a crazy dreamer and with an insatiable desire for travel
            <br>and adventure who could never settle for an ordinary life or conform with the norm.
            <br>After graduating from uni and ‘selling my soul’ as a corporate slave I started to feel like I was
            <br>wasting the best years of my life behind a desk working for someone else’s passions and dreams. </p>
        <p>There had to be more to life than this!
            If you think travel is dangerous try routine. It's lethal travel quote</p>
        <p>Still, most of the time it’s easier to carry on with the routine of the daily grind,
            <br>always dreaming that ‘one day’ you will take that trip, than that take that leap and leave your comfort
            zone.
            <br>The turning point for me was when I was told I had a detached
            <br>retina and had to have an operation on my eye.
            <br>It was the jolt I needed to realise that life is far too short to put off things off,
            <br> or not make the most of every day, even in your twenties you are never too young to get sick.</p>
